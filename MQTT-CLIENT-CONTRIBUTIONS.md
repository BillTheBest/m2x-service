# Guidelines for creating MQTT Client Libraries for M2X

This document aims to provide guidelines to organize the structure and
behavior of AT&T M2X MQTT client libraries in order to keep them consistent with
each other.

This document should be considered a subset of the original [Guidelines for M2X
Client Libraries](MQTT-CLIENT-CONTRIBUTIONS.md). All guidelines discussed here are
specific for the MQTT protocol, but the original document contains the general
expected behavior.

# Supported API methods

The implementation of MQTT in M2X aims to provide support to restricted devices
whose limits make it difficult or impossible to rely on HTTP for communication
with the M2X API and therefore only a subset of the available endpoints should
be supported by MQTT clients. These endpoints include:

1. Device creation: In order for physical devices to be able to initialize
themselves against M2X, the two endpoints that allow creating a device should
be supported.
  - `POST /devices`
  - `POST /distributions/:id/devices`

2. Stream creation: Devices must be able to create the streams they are going to
push data to.
  - `PUT /devices/:id/streams/:name`

3. Values writing.
  - `PUT /devices/:id/streams/:name/value`
  - `POST /devices/:id/streams/:name/values`
  - `POST /devices/:id/updates`

4. Location updates.
  - `PUT /devices/:id/location`
