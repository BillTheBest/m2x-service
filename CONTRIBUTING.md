# Submitting Issues

All feature requests and issues should be initially reported in the [issues section](https://github.com/attm2x/m2x-service/issues). We are following the convention of naming an issue by prefixing its description with the issue type, as in "Feature Request: xxx", "Bug: xxx", or "UI: xxx".

Try to use distinct and descriptive subject lines to make issues easier to identify. The description should include as much information as necessary to define the issue.
